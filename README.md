# MineHaven-1.12.2
### Official MineHaven Modpack for version 1.12.2

MineHaven 1.12.2 is a modpack that is similar to Big Dig from version 1.6.4. The main goal of the pack is to reduce the time to find and mine ores.
For that reason, ore rates (both vein sizes & rarity) have been changed to accomodate the pack. The pack is constantly being updated and patched. It has been in the making for quite a while, coming to form from just a simple idea, however it has not been as simple as the idea made it seem. It will still be buggy and in development, but any version upload will be updated. 

## IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT FROM UPDATES 1.0.0-1.0.5 YOU CREATE A NEW WORLD, AS THE ORE GENERATION WILL BE TINKERED THROUGH THESE UPDATES.
